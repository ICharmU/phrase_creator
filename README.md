# phrase_creator
**IMPORTANT: Code for the javascript file starts on line 2044, before that is the information being used for the phrase generation**   
  
Self guided project from CodeCademy  
  
## Installing the Code  
Download the html and javascript files onto your computer.  
Open up both of the files in Visual Studio Code.  
In the html file's script tag change the source  file location of the downloaded javascript file so that it matches the file location on your computer.  
Still in VSCode, run the html file in your preferred web browser through the debug tool. If this does not work, simply type the file location of the html file in your web browser to open it.  
  
## Using the Code  
To use the phrase generator open the html file in a web browser and click on the button to generate the random phrase.
  
## Specific Purpose  
The goal of this project was to create a phrase generator using random words that could be put together in a decently syntactically correct fashion, even if the logic of the phrase doesn't entirely make sense or is incomplete.  
I aimed to add some basic grammar rules (that are common), such as different uses of plural (-s, -es, -ies, etc.), as well as different context in terms of sentence structure with multiple verbs, differing the ordering of the verbs and nouns.  
I chose to use html and javascript because this allows me to potentially upload my ideas onto the web later, if I so choose. I am also attempting to learn how different parts of web development fit together and this has helped me in doing so.   
  
## Future Plans  
When I learn about new concepts I hope to come back and improve upon the grammar portion in specific to add more specific grammar, not just general words being used in different tenses, but also specific use case words.  
There are also some issues that I don't think I have discovered regarding the current state of grammar rules, however it is difficult to test for every minor issue at the moment. By testing more cases in the future I hope to fix some of these grammar syntax errors.
